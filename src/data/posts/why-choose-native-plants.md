Native plants are the backbone of healthy, sustainable gardens. They've evolved over thousands of years to thrive in local conditions, making them naturally resilient and low-maintenance.

## Benefits of Native Plants

### Adapted to Local Climate
Native plants are already adapted to your region's rainfall patterns, temperature extremes, and soil conditions. This means they require less watering, fertilizing, and general care once established.

### Support Local Wildlife
Native plants have co-evolved with local insects, birds, and other wildlife. They provide the specific nectar, pollen, seeds, and habitat that native species need to survive.

### Reduce Maintenance
Because they're adapted to local conditions, native plants generally require less intervention. No need for excessive watering, fertilizing, or pest control.

### Preserve Biodiversity
By choosing native plants, you're helping to preserve the genetic diversity and ecological relationships that make ecosystems resilient.

## Getting Started with Natives

Start by researching which plants are native to your specific region. Not all native plants are native everywhere! Choose plants suited to your specific conditions (sun, soil, moisture) and enjoy watching your garden become a thriving ecosystem.
